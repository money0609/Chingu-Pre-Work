## Overview
This project provides you with Great Practice Making MODERN LOOKING web apps by cloning the "Conquer" Website Template
in HTML/CSS/JS WITHOUT the Bootstrap and Jquery!

When you download it to check out, the design is made using Bootstrap and Jquery, but we want you to make it without
those libraries, just using your mad HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skillz!

When you are done, this type of template looks terrific and gracefully responds on all devices. You could make different 
versions to use in future web apps you develop!

## Instructions

For this project you must use Native (Vanilla/Plain) HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript for this project. You are encouraged to use
CSS-Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries, a naming system like BEM, semantic HTML tags, or other modern techniques! You may not use frameworks or libraries such as Bootstrap.

General instructions for all Pre-Work Projects are located in the Chingu Voyage Handbook (URL posted in the
`#prework-community-news channel` on Discord). For detailed requirements checkout the ZenHub Board that is part of this repo.
